    <h1>Everything You Need To Know About Diabetes</h1>
    <h3>Symptoms of Diabetes</h3>
    <p>
      General symptoms<br />
      The general symptoms of diabetes include: increased hunger, increased
      thirst, weight loss, frequent urination, blurry vision, extreme fatigue,
      sores that don’t heal.
    </p>
    <h3>Causes of Diabetes</h3>
    <p>
      Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.<br />
      <i>Type 1 diabetes</i> - Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1
      diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and
      destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Genes may play a
      role in some people. It’s also possible that a virus sets off the immune
      system attack.<br /><br />
      <i>Type 2 diabetes</i> - Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of
      genetics and lifestyle factors. Being overweight or obese increases your
      risk too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your
      cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar. This
      condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more
      likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.<br /><br />
      <i>Gestational diabetes</i> - Gestational diabetes is the result of
      hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that
      make a pregnant woman’s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin.
      This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy. Women who are overweight
      when they get pregnant or who gain too much weight during their pregnancy
      are more likely to get gestational diabetes.
